<p>I have a close friend of mine with whom I share (or shared) many projects and activities.</p>
<p>One of those activities was <strong>mathematical olympiads</strong>.</p>
<p>In those competitions, once you enter the room, you are left alone with what you already know, the problem statements, and what you can derive from those.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s told me that in one of those competitions he was able to discover the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation">quadratic equation</a>, because he needed it to solve the problem. He didn&rsquo;t know about it before that.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25920622/169066007-7ca37332-45ee-4037-9b3d-9595d78cf51a.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>This might not be an <em>amazing</em> feat, plenty of people have done the same, and you even learn how to derive that equation when you prove it. However, this sheds some light into his <strong>problem solving approach</strong>.</p>
<p>Indeed, this does not only happen in math competitions, where you are somewhat forced to come up with ideas with what you have.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s not as pushed as everybody else to &ldquo;see what others are doing&rdquo;. Instead, he focuses on solving the problem on his own.</p>
<p>This has a serious drawback, he sometimes <strong>reinvents the wheel</strong>. And many other times, too, he gets to a somewhat wrong or suboptimal solution.</p>
<p>However, he <strong>solves the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>And more importantly, he gets one extra experience point in problem solving.</p>
<p>Other people, can simply quickly Google the solution and be done. Those of us, don&rsquo;t get the extra experience points from thinking about the problem (yet, yes, our solution can be more robust since it&rsquo;s &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; by somebody else).</p>
<p>But what happens when for the problem at hand, <strong>no one has reached a solution?</strong> Or when the problem is too specific to your own circumstance?</p>
<p>Those cases happen often. And by definition we can&rsquo;t be successful applying what others have done before. Not exactly at least.</p>
<p>In those situations, he&rsquo;s got a deep advantange: all that experience in solving problems.</p>
<p>Yes, his solutions can be buggy, somewhat wrong, incomplete, and whatnot.</p>
<p>However, he <strong>solves the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>And for the rest of us, that is the complicated part.</p>
