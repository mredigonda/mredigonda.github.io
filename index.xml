      <description>I have a close friend of mine with whom I share (or shared) many projects and activities.
One of those activities was mathematical olympiads.
In those competitions, once you enter the room, you are left alone with what you already know, the problem statements, and what you can derive from those.
He&amp;rsquo;s told me that in one of those competitions he was able to discover the quadratic equation, because he needed it to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>I recently started lifting weights and exercising more, I wish I would&amp;rsquo;ve done that while I was practicing for IOI / ICPC.
My mind kept telling me that an hour in the gym was an hour I could&amp;rsquo;ve spent practicing for competitions, and while that was technically correct, that didn&amp;rsquo;t took into account all of the benefits from exercising, not only to my health but also directly to my performance in competitions.</description>

      <title>Will everything be faster when Moore&#39;s law is over?</title>

      <description>Moore&amp;rsquo;s law is not really a law, it&amp;rsquo;s just the observation that the number of transistors in computers doubles every two years.
The power of computers has been increasing exponentially for a long time, but we know that due to physical constraints, there&amp;rsquo;s a limit to how much it can grow, at least in the traditional way of adding more transistors*.
Another law, the Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s law, is an adage that says: &amp;ldquo;work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Disable animations, it makes the experience much much faster.
Once you disable animations, using the apps grid (shortcut SUPER + A by default) is lighting fast, and works as an application launcher (it covers the most basic functionality of applications like ulauncher).
Finally, try to set up a script to install your common programs, and also track every configuration change that you do. A git repo with a markdown file will do.</description>

      <description>We add all tasks that we have to or wish to do to our favorite to do list app. After some time, there are too many of them, and many of them are not even written correctly, or even if they are, they don&amp;rsquo;t get any of our time.
2-Minutes Rule The stuppidest thing I did that incredibly worked out outstandingly well was to force myself to spend 2 minutes on each task, sorted from top to bottom in priority (if any), no skipping at all, every day.</description>

      <description>Are you my developer? If yes, well, all the content for this page is in the corresponding layout. I know I know, I must learn how it works, but Hugo sometimes is not so trivial to get right.</description>
