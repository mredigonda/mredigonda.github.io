      <description>Some time ago, I completed a course called &amp;ldquo;Science of Exercise&amp;rdquo;.
One of the very first thing they teach, is the &amp;ldquo;principle of reversibility&amp;rdquo;, that explains that after a period of not using the muscles you&amp;rsquo;ve trained, those muscles go back to baseline level.
I claim that this principle is also applicable to learning in general, and more specific, to mathematics.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t use the mathematics muscles you&amp;rsquo;ve developed for some time, you eventually lose your progress and you go back to some baseline level.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you have files related to the project, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to commit them to the Git repo itself.
Project logo of various sizes, sample files to upload to test different behaviors, screen recordings of bugs, etc.
But you still want to have them in your repo, since they are project-related.
Modifying .gitignore is an option. Since each person could have their own personal files in there, adding a line local to .</description>

      <description>The Problem I wanted to setup automated tests for OpenSupports.
I made them run after each commit with Github Actions, but they failed. Sometimes.
Inside the Ubuntu given by Github Actions, I ran all steps inside Docker containers.
The steps looked like this:
 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - run: make build - run: make run - run: make install - run: make test And all those make commands interact with Docker containers.</description>

      <description>I have a close friend of mine with whom I share (or shared) many projects and activities.
One of those activities was mathematical olympiads.
In those competitions, once you enter the room, you are left alone with what you already know, the problem statements, and what you can derive from those.
He&amp;rsquo;s told me that in one of those competitions he was able to discover the quadratic equation, because he needed it to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>I recently started lifting weights and exercising more, I wish I would&amp;rsquo;ve done that while I was practicing for IOI / ICPC.
My mind kept telling me that an hour in the gym was an hour I could&amp;rsquo;ve spent practicing for competitions, and while that was technically correct, that didn&amp;rsquo;t took into account all of the benefits from exercising, not only to my health but also directly to my performance in competitions.</description>

      <title>Will everything be faster when Moore&#39;s law is over?</title>

      <description>Moore&amp;rsquo;s law is not really a law, it&amp;rsquo;s just the observation that the number of transistors in computers doubles every two years.
The power of computers has been increasing exponentially for a long time, but we know that due to physical constraints, there&amp;rsquo;s a limit to how much it can grow, at least in the traditional way of adding more transistors*.
Another law, the Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s law, is an adage that says: &amp;ldquo;work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Disable animations, it makes the experience much much faster.
Once you disable animations, using the apps grid (shortcut SUPER + A by default) is lighting fast, and works as an application launcher (it covers the most basic functionality of applications like ulauncher).
Finally, try to set up a script to install your common programs, and also track every configuration change that you do. A git repo with a markdown file will do.</description>

      <description>We add all tasks that we have to or wish to do to our favorite to do list app. After some time, there are too many of them, and many of them are not even written correctly, or even if they are, they don&amp;rsquo;t get any of our time.
2-Minutes Rule The stuppidest thing I did that incredibly worked out outstandingly well was to force myself to spend 2 minutes on each task, sorted from top to bottom in priority (if any), no skipping at all, every day.</description>
